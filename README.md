# Hi👋, welcome to my profile!

🧑🏻 I'm Gustavo Chaves, a guy passionate about learning, solving problems and of course, coding!

Despite loving Development area, someday I want to experience being a Game Dev (i reaaly love games) and also work with Cybersecurity.

I like to volunteer to contribute to a cause, like fight for social equality, helping children, preserve the environment or any other just cause. If you know
any project that needs help, let me know :)

📍 I'm always open to learn more and live new experiences!
