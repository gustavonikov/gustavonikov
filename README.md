# Hi👋, welcome to my profile!

A guy passionate about learning, solving problems and of course, coding!

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=gustavonikov&count_private=true&theme=radical&langs_count=10&layout=compact)](https://github.com/gustavonikov/githubreadme-stats)

Despite loving Software Development, someday I want to experience being a Game Dev and also work with Cybersecurity.

I like to volunteer to contribute to a cause, like fight for social equality, helping children, preserve the environment or any other just cause. If you know
any project that needs help, let me know :)

📍 I'm always open to learn more and live new experiences!
